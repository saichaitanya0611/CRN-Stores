        </div>
        <div>

            1. Browsing Products: Users can explore all products or specific products by scrolling through the homepage
            or using category filters. They accomplish this by clicking on specific categories located on top of the
            homepage, or simply scrolling through product listings on the All Products Page.
        </div>

        <div>
            2. Product Search: When users have a specific product in mind, they can use the search bar on the top left
            of the homepage (indicated by the icon ) to enter relevant keywords or phrases, and the app automatically
            (without clicking on the search button) displays a list of matching products, helping users find what
            they're looking for efficiently. (E.g. when you click on ‘Books’, it will display all the books available on
            our site)
        </div>

        <div>
            3. Detailed Product Information: Customers can view detailed information about the product of interest, such
            as product description, price, ratings (in stars), how many people have rated the product, and the product
            reviews. Users can accomplish this either by clicking on the “View details” button on the homepage/All
            Products page, or directly clicking on the Product name.
        </div>

        <div>
            4. Adding Items to Cart: To make a purchase, users can add items to their shopping cart. They do this by
            clicking the "Add to Cart" button on the specific product's page or the homepage. The UI provides feedback
            “Added to Cart” to indicate success. Users can review the items they’ve added to the cart in the Cart Page
            (by clicking on icon on the top right corner of the homepage).
        </div>

        <div>
            5. Removing Items from Cart/ Clearing Cart: After adding items to cart, users can review the cart items in
            the Cart Page (by clicking on icon on the top right corner of the homepage) and remove any unwanted items
            from cart by clicking on the trash icon ( ) next to the item in the cart. They can even clear the cart
            entirely by clicking on the ‘Empty Cart’ button in the Cart page. The UI provides feedback “Your Cart is
            Empty” to indicate success.
        </div>

        <div>
            6. Product Reviews and Ratings: Customers often rely on product reviews and ratings to make informed
            decisions. Users can contribute to this by submitting their own reviews. They accomplish this by opening the
            page of the product they want to review, filling out the review field (under the “Add to Cart” button) and
            clicking on the "Add Review" button. After doing so, users can see that their review has been added to the
            existing list of reviews.
        </div>

        <div>
            7. Creating a New Account: Users can create a new account by clicking on the ‘Sign Up’ button located at the
            top of the homepage. After entering personal details like username, password, first name, last name,
            address, phone number and email, and clicking on the ‘Register’ button (towards the end of the page), the
            user will be registered successfully. If any of the fields are left empty, an appropriate message (e.g.
            field name required) is displayed under the field itself.
            Registration enables users to manage personal information like name, phone number, email, shipping address,
            etc. (which need to be entered each time if the user isn’t registered), track their order history, and
            create and manage wishlists.
        </div>

        <div>
            8. Login to an existing account: Registered users can login to access their account. They achieve this by
            visiting the Login page (by clicking on the ‘Login’ button located at the top of the homepage), entering
            their credentials (username and password), and clicking the ‘Login’ button. If the entered credentials are
            valid, the site will display “Hello” followed by the user’s first name at the top of the homepage. If not,
            it will display an appropriate invalid username/password message.
            The idea behind this use case is to enable the user to add items into a wishlist, manage personal
            information, and track order history (these features would be implemented in the future).
